                With PayTrackr, you can edit, mark as paid or unpaid, and even delete payments as needed. However, it's important to note that once a payment is marked as paid, it becomes a historical transaction that remains unchanged. Any edits made will only affect future payments, ensuring the integrity of your financial records.
